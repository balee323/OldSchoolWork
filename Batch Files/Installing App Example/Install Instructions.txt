Try This first, Has always worked - > run Install_legal_application.bat




BUT just in case, here is the manual method.




Copy all the files to a folder (desktop folder is best choice, I called my folder Legal App)

then register all the OCX and Dlls.



To register the OCX and DLLs
1. Run Command prompt as Admin




C:\Windows\system32>regsvr32 "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Legal App\CRVIEWER.DLL"

C:\Windows\system32>regsvr32 "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Legal App\CCRPDTP.OCX"

	IF Unable to register CCRPDTP.OCX, verify that MSVBVM50.DLL is present in system32 folder.  If  not there, please register the MSVBVM50.DLL. 
	But if MSVBVM50.DLL is in the system32 folder, please consult Development team.
	
C:\Windows\system32>regsvr32 "C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Legal App\MSMASK32.OCX"


(should get a registered successful message each time)


Application will now work natively in windows 7 (can open app, view files, search, add new, etc).  Printing still does not work.


troubleshooting:
	Component 'comctl32.ocx' not correctly registered: File is missing.  -> Resolution:  Register the comctl32.ocx
