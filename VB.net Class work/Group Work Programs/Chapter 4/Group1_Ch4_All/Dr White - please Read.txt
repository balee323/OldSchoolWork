Dear Dr. White

My group had everything done for Group 4 exercises.  Tim was going to upload them today (6th), but he wanted me to look over
it before he uploaded.  Since I have been out of the loop this week with new house and all, I did not realize that 
the exercise was due tonight (6th).  

Long story short- I am not sure if Tim uploaded the project or not, and I may have caused my group to be late, so I will upload
the assignment again just in case.

Also, please please don't penalize us for being late, there was just some miscommunication.
