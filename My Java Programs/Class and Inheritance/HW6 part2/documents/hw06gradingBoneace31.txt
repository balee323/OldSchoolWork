                 status of the game (scores, whose turn it is,face up view
                 of the hands etc) is easy to see.  The programmer's
                 name appears on the screen.                    

________(10 pts) style :
                 Separate the data code from the view code as much as possible.
                 with either version console or GUI.  Easily comprehensible code.

                 (without a GUI view on the game,
